# Backup & Restore cluster kubectl-tg plugin

If you have experience with Custom Resources in Kubernetes (K8S), you can leverage CRs to initiate backup or restore processes. We provide a dedicated document detailing the steps for performing backup and restore using Custom Resources (CRs). [Backup & restore by CR](backup-restore-by-cr.md)

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using kubectl-tg plugin to backup and restore, we highly recommend you to avoid modifying the backup configurations by directly excuting `gadmin config` in the pod.
> If you do that, the configurations set by CR and gadmin config may conflict, leading to some unknown behavior.

## Prerequisite

The successful execution of the `kubectl tg backup|restore|backup-schedule` command relies on the presence of several dependencies: `kubectl`, `helm`, `jq`, and `yq`. It is imperative to ensure that all these components are properly installed on your system.

Furthermore, prior to using the backup command, it is essential to have the TigerGraph Kubectl Plugin installed(please refer to [Install kubectl-tg plugin](../../02-get-started/get_started.md#install-kubectl-tg-plugin)). Additionally, you must create your cluster as a prerequisite step.

## Utilizing `kubectl tg` Command for Backup

To maintain coherence between the `kubectl-tg` command and custom resources presented in YAML format, the `--name` option is employed to specify the name of the custom resources to be created or managed.

### Creating and Updating Backups

```bash
Usage:
  kubectl tg backup [create|update] [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h|--help :                   Display this message.
  -n|--namespace :              Define the namespace for TG cluster deployment. If not set, the 
                                default namespace from the context will be used.
  --name :                      (required) Specify the name of the backup CR.
  -c|--cluster-name :           Define the cluster name for TG cluster deployment. No default value.
  --tag :                       Specify the tag for backup files. For example, if you specify 
                                --tag daily, the backup file will be named daily-20xx-xx-xxTxxxxxx.
                                If you do not specify a tag, the tag will be the same as the name of the backup CR. 
  --staging-path :              Specify the location to store temporary files.
  --timeout :                   Set the backup timeout in seconds. Default: 18000.
  --compress-process-number :   Determine the number of concurrent processes used for compression 
                                during backup. A value of 0 indicates that the number of compression processes will match the number of CPU cores on the nodes.
  --compress-level :            Choose from options: BestSpeed, DefaultCompression, and 
                                BestCompression. Only supported for TG clusters >=3.9.3.
  --incremental :               Perform incremental backup.
  --full :                      Perform a full backup (full backup is the default behavior).
  --destination :               Specify the destination for storing backup files. Currently 
                                supports local and S3 storage.
  --backup-clean-policy:        set the backup clean policy for backup CR, available policy: Delete, Retain, default is Retain
  --min-retry-duration:         set the min duration between two retries, the format is like "5s","10m","1h","1h20m5s"
  --max-retry-duration:         set the max duration between two retries, the format is like "5s","10m","1h","1h20m5s"
  --max-retry :                 set max times of retry for backup job
  --force-delete-after-max-retries: 
                                set if the backup CR should be deleted after max retry, default is false
  -y :                          Provide a positive response to all questions.

  Configuration details for different destinations:
  If the destination is local, you should provide:
    --local-path :              Specify the local path where backup files will be stored.
  If the destination is S3:
    --s3-bucket :               Specify the name of the S3 Bucket.
    --aws-secret :              Provide the name of the AWS secret. 
                                The secret should contain accessKeyID and secretAccessKey.
                                set it to null if you want to remove the secret
    --role-arn:                 the role arn for the backup job to assume, set it to null if you want to remove the role arn
```

#### Backup to Local Storage

use the following command to backup cluster whose name is test-cluster and store backup files in local storage

```bash
 kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-local \
   --cluster-name test-cluster --tag testlocal -n tigergraph \
  --destination local --local-path /home/tigergraph/mybackup 
```

you can also customize timeout, staging path, the compress level and the compress process number

```bash
 kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-local --cluster-name test-cluster \
  --tag testlocal -n tigergraph --destination local \
  --local-path /home/tigergraph/mybackup  --staging-path /home/tigergraph/temp \
  --timeout 18000 --compress-process-number 0 --compress-level BestSpeed
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please don't use subpath of DataRoot or AppRoot as the local path for backup. These paths are forbidden because they may be cleaned up when uninstalling TigerGraph.
> The best practice is to configure an additionalStorage for backup. For example, you can create following yaml file and name it as `tg-backup-storage.yaml`:
> ```yaml
> additionalStorages:
>   - name: tg-backup
>     storageSize: 100Gi
>     mountPath: /home/tigergraph/mybackup
> ```
> And create/update the cluster with option `--additional-storage tg-backup-storage.yaml`.
> Then you can use `/home/tigergraph/mybackup` as the local path for backup.
>
> If you configure staging path by `--staging-path`, the actual staging path will be `${staging_path}/backup`. For example, if you set `--staging-path /home/tigergraph/temp`, the actual staging path will be `/home/tigergraph/temp/backup`. And you should not use `/home/tigergraph/temp/backup` as local path.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please remember which local path you use and use the same path if you want to restore the backup package you create.

#### Backup to a S3 Bucket

Follow the steps below to back up a cluster named "test-cluster" and store the backup files in an S3 bucket. Make sure you provide the S3 bucket name, access key ID, and secret key for S3.

1. First, create a Kubernetes secret containing the access key ID and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=AWSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='AWSSECRETKEY' 
   ```

2. Next, create a backup to the S3 bucket:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-s3 -n tigergraph \
     --cluster-name test-cluster --destination s3Bucket --tag testS3 \
     --s3-bucket tgbackup  \
     --aws-secret aws-secret
   ```

You can also customize the following parameters: timeout, staging path, and the number of compression processes:

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-s3  -n tigergraph \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --tag testS3 --destination s3Bucket \
  --s3-bucket tgbackup \
  --aws-secret aws-secret \
  --staging-path /home/tigergraph/temp \
  --timeout 18000 --compress-process-number 0 --compress-level BestSpeed
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you have created the necessary Kubernetes secret containing the access key ID and secret key before initiating the backup process to the S3 bucket.

#### Backup to a S3 Bucket with RoleARN instead of access key

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is supported from TigerGraph v1.2.0 and TigerGraph v4.1.0

If you want to use RoleARN instead of access key to backup to S3 bucket, you don't have to create a K8s Secret for the backup CR. Instead, you have to make sure that the aws-cli in your TigerGraph cluster can access the S3 bucket with the RoleARN. Please refer to [Create a TigerGraph cluster with access to S3 bucket](./create-tg-with-access-to-s3.md).

If you have a cluster that can access the S3 bucket through aws-cli, you can use the following command to backup to S3 bucket with RoleARN:

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-s3  -n tigergraph \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --destination s3Bucket \
  --s3-bucket tgbackup \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::1234567:role/yourBackupRole
```

#### Backup to a GCS Bucket

Follow the steps below to back up a cluster named "test-cluster" and store the backup files in an GCS bucket. Make sure you provide the GCS bucket name, access key ID, and secret key for GCS.

1. First, create a Kubernetes secret containing the access key ID and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic gcs-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=GCSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='GCSSECRETKEY' 
   ```

2. Next, create a backup to the GCS bucket:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-gcs -n tigergraph \
     --cluster-name test-cluster --destination gcsBucket --tag testGCS \
     --gcs-bucket tgbackup  \
     --gcs-secret gcs-secret
   ```

You can also customize the following parameters: timeout, staging path, and the number of compression processes:

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-gcs  -n tigergraph \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --tag testGCS --destination gcsBucket \
  --gcs-bucket tgbackup \
  --gcs-secret gcs-secret \
  --staging-path /home/tigergraph/temp \
  --timeout 18000 --compress-process-number 0 --compress-level BestSpeed
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you have created the necessary Kubernetes secret containing the access key ID and secret key before initiating the backup process to the GCS bucket.
> This feature is supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.6.0 and TigerGraph 4.2.1


#### Backup to an ABS Container

Follow the steps below to back up a cluster named "test-cluster" and store the backup files in an ABS container. Make sure you provide the ABS container name, access key ID, and secret key for ABS.

1. First, create a Kubernetes secret containing the access key ID and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic abs-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=ABSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='ABSSECRETKEY' 
   ```

2. Next, create a backup to the ABS container:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-abs -n tigergraph \
     --cluster-name test-cluster --destination absContainer --tag testABS \
     --abs-container tgbackup  \
     --abs-secret abs-secret
   ```

You can also customize the following parameters: timeout, staging path, and the number of compression processes:

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-abs  -n tigergraph \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --tag testABS --destination absContainer \
  --abs-container tgbackup \
  --abs-secret abs-secret \
  --staging-path /home/tigergraph/temp \
  --timeout 18000 --compress-process-number 0 --compress-level BestSpeed
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you have created the necessary Kubernetes secret containing the access key ID and secret key before initiating the backup process to the ABS container.
> This feature is supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.6.0 and TigerGraph 4.2.1


#### Configure Backup Clean Policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.2.0 and TigerGraph 3.9.0

As default, the backup package(backup files stored in local or S3) will be retained after the backup CR is deleted. If you want to delete the backup package after the backup CR is deleted, you can set the backup clean policy to Delete. Use option `--backup-clean-policy` to set the backup clean policy. The available policy is Delete and Retain. The default policy is Retain.

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-s3  -n tigergraph \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --destination s3Bucket \
  --s3-bucket tgbackup \
  --aws-secret aws-secret \
  --backup-clean-policy Delete
```

If you create a backup CR by above command and the backup job is finished successfully, when you delete the backup CR, the operator will create a `backup-clean-job` to remove the backup package.
The operator use a finalizer to make sure the backup package is removed before the backup CR is deleted. If the backup package is removed successfully, the finalizer will be removed and backup CR will be deleted. If the backup package is not removed successfully, the backup CR will not be deleted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to delete a backup CR whose clean policy is Delete, you should make sure that
> the cluster is running and the backup package is not used by any other incremental backup CR. Otherwise, the `backup-clean-job` will fail and the deletion of the backup CR will be blocked,
> because when you set the clean policy to Delete, the operator will make sure that the backup package is removed before deleting the backup CR.

If for some reason, the backup package cannot be deleted, and you do not want the deletion of backup CR to be blocked, you can configure the option `--force-delete-after-max-retry true` when creating the backup. Or update the clean policy to Retain through `kubectl tg backup update`. When the backup CR is successfully deleted, you need to manually clear the backup package yourself.

#### Control the retry behavior of backup CR

As default, the backup CR will retry forever until the backup job is successful. If you want to control the retry behavior of backup CR, you can use the following options:

- `--min-retry-duration`: set the min duration between two retries, the format is like "5s","10m","1h","1h20m5s"
- `--max-retry-duration`: set the max duration between two retries, the format is like "5s","10m","1h","1h20m5s"
- `--max-retry`: set max times of retry for backup job

When backup job failed, the backup CR will perform exponential backoff retry. The duration between two retries will start from `min-retry-duration` and double every time until it reaches `max-retry-duration`.
The backup CR will retry `max-retry` times. If the backup job is still failed after `max-retry` times, the backup CR will be marked as failed.

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-s3  -n tigergraph \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --destination s3Bucket \
  --s3-bucket tgbackup \
  --aws-secret aws-secret \
  --min-retry-duration 5m --max-retry-duration 1h --max-retry 5
```

#### [Preview] Performing Incremental Backup

> [!NOTE]
> For TigerGraph version 3.9, performing an incremental backup requires the existence of at least one previous backup for the cluster. Without a prior full backup, attempting an incremental backup will result in failure. To verify the presence of a full backup, you can utilize the command `kubectl tg backup list`.

To initiate an incremental backup, incorporate the `--incremental` option into the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph --name incremental-backup \
  --incremental --tag testlocal \
  --destination local \
  --local-path /home/tigergraph/mybackup
```

#### Updating Backup Custom Resources

If you have previously created a backup using the `kubectl tg backup create` command, you can modify the backup configuration by employing the `kubectl tg backup update` command. Once the `update` command is executed.

Suppose you've already generated a backup using the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-local \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --tag testlocal -n tigergraph \
  --destination local \
  --local-path /home/tigergraph/backup  --staging-path /home/tigergraph/temp \
  --timeout 18000 --compress-process-number 0
```

To adjust the backup timeout, you can execute:

```bash
kubectl tg backup update --name backup-to-local -n tigergraph \
--timeout 20000
```

Subsequently, the timeout value will be updated to 20000, and a backup process with the revised timeout setting will be immediately initiated.

##### Update the way to access S3 bucket

In TigerGraph 4.1.0 and TigerGraph Operator 1.2.0, you are allowed to set AWS access key and RoleARN at the same time.
If you set both of them, TigerGraph will only use RoleARN to access S3 bucket. So when you have created a backup to s3 using RoleARN, and you want to
update the backup CR to use access key, you have to clear the RoleARN setting by adding option `--role-arn null`:

```bash
kubectl tg backup update --destination s3Bucket \
        --aws-secret $AWS_SECRET  \
        --role-arn null
```

When you want to update the backup CR to use RoleARN, you can also clear the AWS access key setting by adding option `--aws-secret null`:

```bash
kubectl tg backup update --destination s3Bucket \
        --aws-secret null  \
        --role-arn arn:aws:iam::1234567:role/yourBackupRole
```

#### Creating Another Backup

If you have previously initiated a backup using the `kubectl tg backup create` command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup create --name backup-to-local \
  --cluster-name test-cluster --tag testlocal -n tigergraph \
  --destination local \
  --local-path /home/tigergraph/backup 
```

And you wish to create a new backup with the same configuration, you can execute:

```bash
kubectl tg backup update --name backup-to-local -n tigergraph
```

The system will prompt you to confirm whether you want to initiate the backup again. You should type "y" to proceed.

Alternatively, you can employ the `-y` option, indicating "yes to all questions," to immediately start the backup:

```bash
kubectl tg backup update --name backup-to-local -n tigergraph -y
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you configure the clean policy to Delete, when you run the above command, the previous
> backup package will be removed before the new backup job is started.
> If you want to keep the previous backup package, you should set the clean policy to Retain.

### Listing Backup Custom Resources

To retrieve a list of all backup Custom Resources (CRs) within a specific namespace, utilize the following command:

```bash
kubectl get tgbackup --namespace tigergraph
```

This command will provide you with an overview of the backup CRs present in the designated namespace.

### Displaying Backup Process Status

Upon executing `kubectl tg backup create/update`, a backup job will be generated within the Kubernetes (k8s) environment. To facilitate monitoring, we offer the `kubectl tg backup status` command, allowing you to assess the status of the backup process. Should you encounter errors or warnings, refer to the [How to Debug Backup & Restore](./troubleshoot.md) section for troubleshooting guidance.

To display the status of all backup processes within the `tigergraph` namespace, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup status --namespace tigergraph
```

The output will resemble the following:

```bash
NAME                        CLUSTER        TAG     STORAGE   INCREMENTAL   STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
test-cluster-backup-daily   test-cluster   daily   local                   3d12h       
test-cluster-backup-local   test-cluster   local   local                   16s         5s
```

If the `COMPLETIONTIME` field is not empty, it indicates a successful backup process.

For detailed information about a specific backup process, execute:

```bash
kubectl tg backup status --name test-cluster-backup-daily \
  --namespace tigergraph
```

The output provides a comprehensive overview of the backup process, including configurations and status details. You'll find events that indicate the progress and outcome of the backup job.

The output is like this:

```bash
kubectl tg backup status --cluster-name test-cluster --tag daily

You can identify the occurrence of events marked as "Backup job failed," which indicates that the respective backup task has encountered a failure.

### Delete Backup Custom Resource (CR)

To remove a backup Custom Resource (CR), execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup delete --name backup-to-local --namespace tigergraph
```

### Listing Backups

To list available backups, utilize the command:

```bash
Usage:
  kubectl tg backup list [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --cluster-name :  (required) Set the name of the target cluster.
  -n, --namespace : Set the namespace of the target cluster.
  --tag :           Specify the tag of the backup.
  --json :          Output in JSON format.
  --meta :          Retrieve the metadata of the backup.
```

To examine the existing backups for a particular cluster, you can employ the following commands to list all backups associated with the "test-cluster":

```bash
kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph
```

If you prefer to obtain the backup list in JSON format, use:

```bash
kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph --json
```

In the context of a cross-cluster restore, acquiring backup metadata is essential. To accomplish this, utilize the tag obtained from the `kubectl tg backup list` command. Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph \
  --tag tests3-2022-10-31T031005 --meta
```

This command will display the metadata in the standard output. If you wish to store this metadata in a file, execute:

```bash
kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph --tag tests3 --meta > metadata
```

### Removing Backups

To eliminate backups that are no longer needed, follow these steps:

Use the following command to remove specific backups associated with the "test-cluster" and located in the "tigergraph" namespace:

```bash
kubectl tg backup remove --cluster-name test-cluster --namespace tigergraph \
  --tag daily-20xx-xx-xxTxxxxx
```

This command enables you to selectively remove backups based on their tags. Please ensure you accurately specify the relevant cluster name, namespace, and backup tag when executing this command.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have configured `--clean-policy Delete` when you create backup, there is no need to manually remove the backup.
> The operator will automatically remove the backup package when you delete the backup CR.

## Creating and Managing Backup Schedules

The `kubectl tg backup-schedule` command enables you to create, update, monitor, list, delete, pause, and resume backup schedules for specific clusters. This comprehensive set of options empowers you to effortlessly manage your backup scheduling requirements.

```bash
Usage:
  kubectl tg backup-schedule [create|update|status|list|delete|pause|resume] [OPTIONS]

Commands:
  create                        Create a backup schedule to schedule backup for specific cluster

    --role-arn:                 the role arn for the backup job to assume, set it to null if you want to remove the role arn
```

### Specifying Backup Schedule

To define a backup schedule, utilize a cron expression to set the timing. You can conveniently generate cron expressions using tools like [https://crontab.guru/](https://crontab.guru/), which provides an intuitive interface for creating intricate schedules.

For instance, if you desire to execute a backup once daily at 00:00, you would specify the following cron expression:

```bash
--schedule '0 0 * * *'
```

Please ensure to enclose the cron expression in single quotation marks (`'`) to prevent unintended filename expansion.

### Creating Backup Schedules

#### Creating a Local Backup Schedule

   To create a schedule that performs daily backups for the "test-cluster" at 00:00, storing backup files locally, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup-schedule create --name backupsch-local \
     --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph \
     --tag localdaily --schedule '0 0 * * *' \
     --destination local --local-path /home/tigergraph/backup
   ```

#### Creating a S3 Backup Schedule

   For a schedule that conducts hourly backups for the "test-cluster" at minute 0, storing backup files in an S3 bucket, proceed as follows:

   First, create a secret containing access key id and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=AWSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='AWSSECRETKEY' 
   ```

   Next, establish the backup schedule:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup-schedule create --name backupsch-s3 \ 
     --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph \
     --tag s3daily --schedule '0 * * * *' --destination s3Bucket\
     --s3-bucket tgbackup \
     --aws-secret aws-secret
   ```

By executing these commands, you'll set up automatic backup schedules tailored to your requirements.

<!-- Now we hide this part for user because incremental backup is a Preview feature
### Creating an Incremental Backup Schedule

To establish an incremental backup schedule, please consult the details provided in [Performing incremental backup](#performing-incremental-backup). It is essential to ensure the existence of a pre-existing full backup for the cluster before initiating incremental backups.

Use the `--incremental` option to schedule an incremental backup:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule create --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph \
 --tag localdaily --schedule '0 0 * * *' --incremental \
 --destination local --local-path /home/tigergraph/backup
```
-->
#### Creating a S3 Backup Schedule with RoleARN instead of access key

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.2.0 and TigerGraph 4.1.0

If you want to use RoleARN instead of access key to backup to S3 bucket, you don't have to create a K8s Secret for the backup CR. Instead, you have to make sure that the aws-cli in your TigerGraph cluster can access the S3 bucket with the RoleARN. Please refer to [Create a TigerGraph cluster with access to S3 bucket](./create-tg-with-access-to-s3.md).

If you have a cluster that can access the S3 bucket through aws-cli, you can use the following command to create a backup schedule to S3 bucket with RoleARN:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule create --name backupsch-s3 \ 
 --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph \
 --tag s3daily --schedule '0 * * * *' --destination s3Bucket\
 --s3-bucket tgbackup \
 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::1234567:role/yourBackupRole
```

#### Creating a GCS Backup Schedule

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.6.0 and TigerGraph 4.2.1

   For a schedule that conducts hourly backups for the "test-cluster" at minute 0, storing backup files in an GCS bucket, proceed as follows:

   First, create a secret containing access key id and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic gcs-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=GCSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='GCSSECRETKEY' 
   ```

   Next, establish the backup schedule:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup-schedule create --name backupsch-gcs \ 
     --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph \
     --tag gcsdaily --schedule '0 * * * *' --destination gcsBucket\
     --gcs-bucket tgbackup \
     --gcs-secret gcs-secret
   ```

By executing these commands, you'll set up automatic backup schedules tailored to your requirements.

#### Creating an ABS Backup Schedule

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.6.0 and TigerGraph 4.2.1

   For a schedule that conducts hourly backups for the "test-cluster" at minute 0, storing backup files in an ABS container, proceed as follows:

   First, create a secret containing access key id and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic abs-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=ABSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='ABSSECRETKEY' 
   ```

   Next, establish the backup schedule:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup-schedule create --name backupsch-abs \ 
     --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph \
     --tag absdaily --schedule '0 * * * *' --destination absContainer \
     --abs-container tgbackup \
     --abs-secret abs-secret
   ```

By executing these commands, you'll set up automatic backup schedules tailored to your requirements.

#### Control the retry behavior of backup CR created by backup schedule

Since operator 1.1.0, the operator will create backup CR at scheduled instead of utilizing the K8s CronJob. So you are able to control the retry behavior of backup CR created by backup schedule.
When you configure `--force-delete-after-max-retry`, `--clean-policy`, `--min-retry-duration`, `--max-retry-duration`, `--max-retry` for backup schedule, the operator will set these configurations to the backup CR created by the schedule.

Please refer to [Control the retry behavior of backup CR](#control-the-retry-behavior-of-backup-cr) and [Configure Backup Clean Policy](#configure-backup-clean-policy) if you want to customize the behavior of backup CR created by the backup schedule.

### Updating a Backup Schedule

When updating a backup schedule, ensure you provide the correct name.

For instance, to adjust the schedule for daily backups at 12:00, execute the following:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule update --name backupsch-local \
 --tag localdaily --schedule '0 12 * * *'
```

Please note that ongoing backup jobs remain unaffected by configuration changes. The new configuration will take effect during the subsequent schedule.

### Listing All Backup Schedules

To view a comprehensive list of all existing backup schedules within a specific namespace, employ the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule list --namespace tigergraph
```

#### Update the way to access S3 bucket in Backup Schedule

In TigerGraph 4.1.0 and TigerGraph Operator 1.2.0, you are allowed to set AWS access key and RoleARN at the same time.
If you set both of them, TigerGraph will only use RoleARN to access S3 bucket. So when you have created a backup to s3 using RoleARN, and you want to
update the backup CR to use access key, you have to clear the RoleARN setting by adding option `--role-arn null`:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule update --destination s3Bucket \
        --aws-secret $AWS_SECRET  \
        --role-arn null
```

When you want to update the backup CR to use RoleARN, you can also clear the AWS access key setting by adding option `--aws-secret null`:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule update --destination s3Bucket \
        --aws-secret null  \
        --role-arn arn:aws:iam::1234567:role/yourBackupRole
```

### Deleting a Backup Schedule

To remove a backup schedule, execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule delete --name backupsch-local \
  --namespace tigergraph
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a backup schedule is deleted, the backup CRs created by the schedule will also be deleted. If you want to keep the backup CRs, you should update the backup clean policy to Retain for all backup CRs
> created by the schedule before deleting the schedule. Or you can pause the backup schedule instead of deleting it.

### Showing Backup Schedule Status

To retrieve the status of a backup schedule, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule status --name test-cluster-schedule-daily \
  --namespace tigergraph
```

The output will provide insights into the status of the specified backup schedule, allowing you to monitor its progress and execution.

```bash

  Normal  Backup job created       10s (x2 over 71s)  TigerGraphBackupSchedule  Schedule a new backup job
```

Indeed, the events associated with backup schedule executions provide valuable insights into the success or failure of the scheduled jobs. By examining these events, you can ascertain whether the backup schedules were executed as intended and if any issues arose during the process.

### Pausing and Resuming a Backup Schedule

You have the ability to temporarily halt a running backup schedule or resume a paused one using the following commands:

To pause a currently active backup schedule:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule pause --name backupsch-local -n tigergraph
```

This action will prevent the scheduling of the next backup job.

To resume a paused backup schedule:

```bash
kubectl tg backup-schedule resume --name backupsch-local -n tigergraph
```

### Backup Strategy Overview

It's important to note that the backup strategy feature is available for cluster versions equal to or greater than 3.9.0. This feature provides enhanced control over backup operations and file retention. Presently, you have three distinct options at your disposal to facilitate a comprehensive backup strategy:

1. **`--max-retry`**: This parameter allows you to specify the maximum number of retry attempts for each backup job. It helps ensure that backup processes have a predefined limit of retries in the event of any unexpected issues.

2. **`--max-backup-file`**: As time progresses, the accumulation of backup files can consume substantial disk space. You can utilize this parameter to determine the maximum number of backup files to retain. For instance, setting `--max-backup-file 10` will retain the latest 10 backup files according to the specified tag.

3. **`--max-reserved-day`**: This parameter governs the maximum number of days that backups are retained. If a backup is created more than the defined number of days ago, it will be automatically deleted, thus optimizing storage management.

For example, consider a backup schedule with `--max-backup-file 10`, the operator will ensure that only the latest 10 backup CRs created by the backup schedule are retained. If the number of backups exceeds 10, the operator will automatically delete the oldest backup CRs to maintain the specified limit.

Furthermore, with `--max-reserved-day 7`, backup CRs created more than 7 days ago will be deleted, aligning with your defined retention strategy.

By leveraging these options, you can meticulously manage your backup jobs and safeguard against excessive disk usage. This proactive approach to backup strategy aids in optimizing storage utilization while preserving the necessary backups for operational needs.

## Utilizing `kubectl tg` for Restore

When you possess backups generated through the backup process or backup schedule, you have the capability to restore your cluster to a previous state. You can initiate restore from a backup that was crafted by the same cluster, and this feature extends to both local storage and S3 buckets.

It's important to highlight that we also offer cross-cluster restore, enabling you to restore Cluster B utilizing backups from Cluster A. As of now, this functionality exclusively supports S3 buckets.

A crucial consideration is that the restore process is currently restricted to clusters featuring the same partition configuration as the cluster that originated the backup.

|  Scenarios   | Is Partition changed?  | Is HA changed? | Support or not | Example(x\*y means x partitions and y ha) |
|  ----  | ----  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Clone an identical cluster | N | N | Y | Source cluster: 3\*2, Target cluster: 3\*2 |
| Restore in a cluster with different partition | Y | N or Y | N | Source cluster: 3*x, Target cluster: 2\*3 or 2\*2 |
| Restore in a cluster with different HA | N | Y | Y | Source cluster: 3\*3, Target cluster: 3\*1 |

```bash
USAGE:
  kubectl tg restore [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h|--help: show this message
  -n|--namespace :              set namespace to deploy TG cluster, default namespace is current namespace
  -c|--cluster-name :           set cluster-name to deploy TG cluster, no default
  --name:                       specify name of restore
  --tag :                       specify the tag of backup files. you can use kubectl tg backup list to get all existing backups
  --metadata :                  specify the metadata file of backup. you should this if you want a cross-cluster restore
  --cluster-template :          configure the cluster you want to create from exported CR
  --staging-path :              specify where to store the temporary files
  --source :                    set the source to get backup files, support local and s3 now
  --min-retry-duration:         set the min duration between two retries, the format is like "5s","10m","1h","1h20m5s"
  --max-retry-duration:         set the max duration between two retries, the format is like "5s","10m","1h","1h20m5s"
  --max-retry :                 set max times of retry for restore job
  Followings are about the configuration of different destination:
  If destination is local,you should provide:
    --local-path :              set the local path where to store backup files
  If destination is s3:
    --s3-bucket :               S3 Bucket name
    --aws-secret :              name of secret for aws, the secret should contain  accessKeyID and secretAccessKey
    --role-arn:                 the role arn for the backup job to assume, set it to null if you want to remove the role arn
```

### Restore within the Same Cluster

Suppose you have previously created a backup for `test-cluster` using the `kubectl tg backup create` command. To initiate restore within the same cluster, retrieve the tag of all Backups first:

Execute the following command to retrieve the tags associated with all available backups:

```bash
kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph
```

The output will provide a list of backups along with their respective tags, types, versions, sizes, and creation timestamps. Choose the backup you intend to restore from based on your requirements.

For instance:

```bash
+------------------------------+------+---------+--------+---------------------+
|             TAG              | TYPE | VERSION |  SIZE  |     CREATED AT      |
+------------------------------+------+---------+--------+---------------------+
| daily-2022-11-02T103601      | FULL | 3.9.0   | 1.7 MB | 2022-11-02 10:36:02 |
| daily-2022-11-02T104925      | FULL | 3.9.0   | 1.7 MB | 2022-11-02 10:49:25 |
| daily-2022-11-09T081545      | FULL | 3.9.0   | 1.7 MB | 2022-11-09 08:15:46 |
| daily-2022-11-09T081546      | FULL | 3.9.0   | 1.7 MB | 2022-11-09 08:15:53 |
+------------------------------+------+---------+--------+---------------------+
```

Since Operator 1.1.0, you can also find the backup tags in the status of the backup CR:

```bash
kubectl tg backup status --name test-cluster-backup \
 --namespace tigergraph
```

The output will provide information of backup package in status:

```bash
 Status:
   Backup Info:
     Size Bytes:     1139208
     Tag:            test-backup-2024-02-06T065203

     Message:               Backup succeed
     Reason:                BackupSucceed
     Status:                True
     Type:                  Succeed
   Start Time:              2024-02-06T06:52:01Z
   Target Ready:            true
```

#### Using backup in local storage

To restore your cluster utilizing a backup stored in local storage, execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg restore --name restore-from-local \
  --cluster-name test-cluster -n tigergraph --tag daily-2022-11-02T103601\
  --source local --local-path /home/tigergraph/backup
```

Replace  `/home/tigergraph/backup` with the appropriate path to the backup stored in your local storage. This command will initiate the restore process and bring your cluster back to the state captured by the specified backup.

#### Use backup in s3 bucket

First, create a secret containing access key id and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster you want to restore:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --namespace tigergraph \
    --from-literal=accessKeyID=AWSACCESSKEY \
    --from-literal=secretAccessKey='AWSSECRETKEY' 
```

Select a backup tag from the available backups and execute the following command to initiate restore from an S3 bucket:

```bash
kubectl tg restore --name restore-from-s3 \
  --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name test-cluster \
  --tag tests3-2022-10-31T031005 \
  --source s3Bucket --s3-bucket tg-backup \
  --aws-secret aws-secret
```

Make sure to replace tests3-2022-10-31T031005 with the desired backup tag and adjust tg-backup to your S3 bucket name. This command will trigger the restore process, bringing your cluster back to the chosen backup's state.

#### Use backup in s3 bucket with RoleARN (Supported from operator 1.2.0 and TigerGraph 4.1.0)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use RoleARN instead of access key to restore from S3 bucket, you don't have to create a K8s Secret for the backup CR. Instead, you have to make sure that the aws-cli in your TigerGraph cluster can access the S3 bucket with the RoleARN. Please refer to [Create a TigerGraph cluster with access to S3 bucket](./create-tg-with-access-to-s3.md).

```bash
kubectl tg restore --name restore-from-s3 \
  --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name test-cluster \
  --tag tests3-2022-10-31T031005 \
  --source s3Bucket --s3-bucket tg-backup \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::1234567:role/yourBackupRole
```

#### Use backup in GCS bucket (Supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.6.0 and TigerGraph 4.2.1)

First, create a secret containing access key id and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster you want to restore:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic gcs-secret --namespace tigergraph \
    --from-literal=accessKeyID=GCSACCESSKEY \
    --from-literal=secretAccessKey='GCSSECRETKEY' 
```

Select a backup tag from the available backups and execute the following command to initiate restore from an GCS bucket:

```bash
kubectl tg restore --name restore-from-gcs \
  --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name test-cluster \
  --tag testgcs-2025-03-31T021006 \
  --source gcsBucket --gcs-bucket tg-backup \
  --gcs-secret gcs-secret
```

Make sure to replace testgcs-2025-03-31T021006 with the desired backup tag and adjust tg-backup to your gcs bucket name. This command will trigger the restore process, bringing your cluster back to the chosen backup's state.

#### Use backup in ABS container (Supported from TigerGraph Operator 1.6.0 and TigerGraph 4.2.1)

First, create a secret containing access key id and secret key in the same namespace as the cluster you want to restore:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic abs-secret --namespace tigergraph \
    --from-literal=accessKeyID=ABSACCESSKEY \
    --from-literal=secretAccessKey='ABSSECRETKEY' 
```

Select a backup tag from the available backups and execute the following command to initiate restore from an ABS container:

```bash
kubectl tg restore --name restore-from-abs \
  --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name test-cluster \
  --tag testabs-2025-04-22T091106 \
  --source absContainer --abs-bucket tg-backup \
  --abs-secret abs-secret
```

Make sure to replace testabs-2025-04-22T091106 with the desired backup tag and adjust tg-backup to your ABS container name. This command will trigger the restore process, bringing your cluster back to the chosen backup's state.

### Cross-Cluster Restore from Backup

> [!NOTE]
> This section pertains to users utilizing TigerGraph cluster version 3.9.2 or higher. If you are operating on an earlier version, please consult the [Restore an Existing Cluster from Backup Created by Another Cluster (Cluster version < 3.9.2)](#restore-an-existing-cluster-from-backup-created-by-another-cluster-cluster-version--392) section for relevant instructions.

Performing a cross-cluster restore, where you restore an existing cluster (target-cluster) using a backup created by another cluster (source-cluster), requires careful steps. Follow the instructions below for a successful cross-cluster restore:

1. **Retrieve the Backup Tag from the Source Cluster:**

   Obtain the backup tag from the source cluster (source-cluster) using the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name source-cluster --namespace tigergraph
   ```

2. **Use the Tag to Restore the Target Cluster:**

   Create an AWS secret for authentication if you haven't done so already:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=AWSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='AWSSECRETKEY'
   ```

   Then, initiate the cross-cluster restore for the target cluster (target-cluster) using the obtained backup tag:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg restore --name cross-restore \
     --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name target-cluster \
     --tag tests3-2022-10-31T031005 \
     --source s3Bucket --s3-bucket tg-backup \
     --aws-secret aws-secret
   ```

Remember to adjust the cluster names, backup tag, S3 bucket name, and AWS credentials as needed for your specific setup. Cross-cluster restore is a powerful way to recover data and configurations across different clusters, ensuring data resilience and system stability.

### Clone Cluster from Backup

> [!NOTE]
> This section pertains to users utilizing TigerGraph cluster version 3.9.2 or higher. If you are operating on an earlier version, please consult the [Clone a Cluster (Cluster version \< 3.9.2)](#clone-a-cluster-cluster-version--392)

Creating a new cluster and restoring it from a backup created by another cluster, often referred as "cloning", involves several steps. Follow these instructions to successfully clone a cluster using the `kubectl tg restore` command:

1. **Retrieve the Cluster Configuration of the Source Cluster:**

   Export the custom resource (CR) configuration of the source cluster (source-cluster) and save it to a YAML file, for example:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg export --cluster-name source-cluster -n tigergraph
   ```

   Assume the output file is /home/test-cluster_backup_1668069319.yaml.

2. **Retrieve the Backup Tag:**

   Obtain the backup tag associated with the desired backup from the source cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name source-cluster --namespace tigergraph
   ```

3. **Use the Configuration and Backup Tag to Create a Cluster Clone:**

   Create an AWS secret for authentication if you haven't done so already:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --namespace tigergraph \
       --from-literal=accessKeyID=AWSACCESSKEY \
       --from-literal=secretAccessKey='AWSSECRETKEY'
   ```

   Initiate the cluster cloning process using the cluster configuration template and the backup tag:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg restore --name cross-restore \
     --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name new-cluster \
     --tag tests3-2022-10-31T031005 --cluster-template /home/test-cluster_backup_1668069319.yaml \
     --source s3Bucket --s3-bucket tg-backup  \
     --aws-secret aws-secret
   ```

By following these steps, you can easily perform cross-cluster restore or clone a cluster using backup files created by another cluster. Be sure to replace placeholders such as `source-cluster`, `target-cluster`, `AWSACCESSKEY`, `AWSSECRETKEY`, and file paths with actual values specific to your environment.

Once the process is complete, the new cluster (`new-cluster`) will be initialized and ready for use. The restore ensures that the new cluster matches the state of the source cluster captured by the backup. Cloning a cluster from a backup is a powerful way to quickly replicate environments and configurations for testing, development, or disaster recovery purposes.

### Cross-Cluster Restore and Cluster Clone (Cluster Version < 3.9.2)

Starting from TigerGraph cluster version 3.9.2, the process for cross-cluster restore and cluster cloning has been simplified. You only need the backup tag to specify the backup file that you want to restore. If you are using cluster < 3.9.2, you need to follow the instructions below:

#### Restore an Existing Cluster from Backup Created by Another Cluster (Cluster version < 3.9.2)

1. **Retrieve Backup Metadata for Source Cluster:**

   Obtain the metadata of the backup from the source cluster (source-cluster) and save it to a file named `backup-metadata`. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name source-cluster --namespace tigergraph \
     --tag tests3-2022-10-31T031005 --meta > backup-metadata
   ```

2. **Create AWS Secret for Authentication:**

   If you haven't done so already, create a Kubernetes secret containing your AWS credentials for authentication:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --namespace tigergraph \
     --from-literal=accessKeyID=AWSACCESSKEY \
     --from-literal=secretAccessKey='AWSSECRETKEY'
   ```

   Replace `AWSACCESSKEY` and `AWSSECRETKEY` with your actual AWS access key ID and secret access key.

3. **Initiate Cross-Cluster Restore:**

   Execute the following command to initiate the cross-cluster restore process for the target cluster (target-cluster) using the backup metadata obtained from the source cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg restore --name cross-restore \
     --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name target-cluster \
     --metadata backup-metadata \
     --source s3Bucket --s3-bucket tg-backup \
     --aws-secret aws-secret
   ```

   This command will initiate the cross-cluster restore, ensuring that the target-cluster is brought back to the state captured by the backup from the source-cluster.

Remember to adjust the cluster names, backup tag, S3 bucket name, and AWS credentials as needed for your specific setup. Cross-cluster restores are a powerful way to recover data and configurations across different clusters, ensuring data resilience and system stability.

#### Clone a Cluster (Cluster version < 3.9.2)

Creating a new cluster and restoring it from a backup created by another cluster, often referred to as "cloning," involves several steps. Follow these instructions to successfully clone a cluster using the `kubectl tg restore` command:

1. **Export Configuration of Source Cluster:**

    Obtain the custom resource (CR) configuration of the source cluster (source-cluster) and save it to a YAML file. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl tg export --cluster-name source-cluster -n tigergraph
    ```

   Assume the output file is /home/test-cluster_backup_1668069319.yaml.
   This file will serve as the template for creating the new cluster.

2. **Retrieve Backup Metadata for Source Cluster:**

   Obtain the metadata of the backup from the source cluster (source-cluster) and save it to a file named `backup-metadata`. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg backup list --cluster-name source-cluster --namespace tigergraph \
     --tag tests3-2022-10-31T031005 --meta > backup-metadata
   ```

3. **Create AWS Secret for Authentication:**

   If you haven't done so already, create a Kubernetes secret containing your AWS credentials for authentication:

   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic aws-secret --namespace tigergraph \
     --from-literal=accessKeyID=AWSACCESSKEY \
     --from-literal=secretAccessKey='AWSSECRETKEY'
   ```

   Replace `AWSACCESSKEY` and `AWSSECRETKEY` with your actual AWS access key ID and secret access key.

4. **Initiate Cluster Clone and Restore:**

   Execute the following command to create a new cluster (new-cluster) based on the configuration template and restore it from the backup created by the source cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl tg restore --name cross-restore \
     --namespace tigergraph --cluster-name new-cluster \
     --metadata backup-metadata --cluster-template /home/test-cluster_backup_1668069319.yaml \
     --source s3Bucket --s3-bucket tg-backup  \
     --aws-secret aws-secret
   ```

   This command will create a new cluster named `new-cluster` based on the provided cluster template and restore its state from the specified backup.

Once the process is complete, the new cluster (`new-cluster`) will be initialized and ready for use. The restore ensures that the new cluster matches the state of the source cluster captured by the backup.

Remember to adjust the cluster names, backup tag, S3 bucket name, paths, and AWS credentials as needed for your specific setup. Cloning a cluster from a backup is a powerful way to quickly replicate environments and configurations for testing, development, or disaster recovery purposes.

### Show Status of Restore

To check the status of a restore process, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg restore status --name restore-from-local --namespace $NAMESPACE
```

This command will provide you with details about the ongoing or completed restore process. You can review the information in the output, including any events or messages related to the restore job. The status will indicate whether the restore was successful or if there were any issues.

### Delete Restore Job

If you want to delete a restore job, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl tg restore delete --name restore-from-local --namespace $NAMESPACE
```

This command will delete the specified restore job. Make sure to replace `restore-from-local` with the actual name of the restore job you want to delete, and provide the appropriate namespace using the `$NAMESPACE` variable.
